# WSA-automatic-apk-installer
The WSA Automatic APK Installer automatically builds an ADB debugging connection and installs .apk files. If you don't have WSA installed, I've included a tutorial in the script for installing WSA with Magisk and the Play Store. Alternatively, you can use the standard Microsoft version. Here is the GitHub repository for WSA with Magisk.
